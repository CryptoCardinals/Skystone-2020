You can always ask questions, make comments, and/or voice your concerns in slack or the team Discord. You can also post things
    here. Type your name and question anywhere below. Once you are answered, please delete your question as to keep this file
    from getting cluttered. There is no garnette that your questions will be answered if you post here. The best method is
    Discord or Slack.

    ex. Alek- Why isn't my program working?
