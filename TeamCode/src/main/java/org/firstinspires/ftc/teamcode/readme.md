## TeamCode Module

Welcome!

This module, TeamCode, is the place where you will write/paste the code for your team's
robot controller App. This module is currently empty (a clean slate) but the
process for adding OpModes is straightforward.

## This is a new branch off of the master file. In this branch, any code can be changed and completely destroyed without
    ruining the official team code. If you did not mean to move to this branch, click on the drop-down labeled Git: experimental.
    Under Local Branches, you should see master. Click on this and click checkout.
