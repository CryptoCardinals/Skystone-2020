## Welcome!
This is the GitHub repository used to store code for the team 14828, the Crypto Cardinals. This
repository is for version control of the official team code. Any changes to this code will be run
during compitions. Please <b>DO NOT</b> change any of the code if you are not an experienced programmer
<b> AND </b> have had your changes approved by the lead programmer.

## Contents
This repository contains the code for both the teleOP and Autonomos periods of the competion. Not all of the
programs show will be used. If you want to add your own code, please put it into your own folder rather than
 changing the official code. <i>Information about doing this is provided in the section labled Wirting Your Own
 Code.</i>


## Writing Your Own Code
If you would like to change any of the programs in the SkyStone folder, please make a copy of it first and
 change it in your folder. In the TeamCode> java> org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder, you should see a folder
 labled as your name.

 Steps for copying and updating the program are provided below.

 * Right click on the program file you would like to copy

 * Select the option that says Copy

 * Right click on your folder

 * Select the option that says Paste

 * Rename the file how ever you want

 * You may now change the file however you would like


 ## Upload New Code
 After you have changed anything in the code, you will have to commit and push it to the repository for other
 programmers to see. There are a few steps to change the code.

 * Click on the green check near the top right of the screen in Android Studio

 * Type in an update message (Say what you change, why you changed it, and your name)in the box labeled commit message

 * Click commit at the bottom of the pop-up
 
 * If you see a message telling you that there are no errors, only warning, you should be fine to push the code

* If you see a message that says there are some errors, <b>DO NOT PUSH THE CODE</b>. View the errors and fix them before pushing


Once you finish doing all the prior steps, you will need to push the code to GitHub

* Hold Ctrl, Shift, and press 'k'

* Click Push at the bottom




## Getting Updated Code
If you want to get the latest code that has been pushed by other users, you will have to pull the data. This is much easier
 to do than pushing your code.

 * Click the blue arrow next to the green check mark

 * Click Ok
 
 
 ## Merge Pop-up
 Sometimes after uploading your code and\or when you pull code, a pop-up will ask you about merging documents. If you are uploading 
 code <b>from your own personal folder</b> and get this message, click merge at the bottom of the pop-up. If you are downloading code, 
 look for 'merge theirs' towards the right side, top of the pop-up. <b>This only applies for certain situations. It is best to ask 
 for help if/when this occurs</b>. If you are ever unsure about what to do when this message occurs, 
 do not hesitate to ask the lead programmer for help. If you click the wrong thing, you may mess up someone elses code.


## Help
When programming, if you ever come upon an error or message that you don't understand, <b>do not attempt to solve the problem on your own</b>. The only exception is if you are <b>100%</b> confident you know what you are doing, or if you have been told to do so, by the
 lead programmer, prior. The lead programmer is there to help. If you thing you mave have broken something\messed something up, it is
  better to tell someone than wait for it to become a bigger problem later.
  
  
## Learning to Progarm
If you are just starting out programming, there are many helpful things that can teach you how. Some options for learning to program
 are give below.
 
* Ask the lead programmer or the lead-assistant programmer to teach you

* Look through some of the example code located in the FtcRobotController> java> org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller> external.samples

* Watch some tutorials on YouTue by other FTC teams

* Look through some of the code written by the team
