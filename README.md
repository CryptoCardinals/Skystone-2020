## Welcome!
This is the GitHub repository used to store code for the team 14828, the Crypto Cardinals. This
repository is for version control of the official team code. Any changes to this code will be run
during compitions. Please <b>DO NOT</b> change any of the code if you are not an experienced programmer
<b> AND </b> have had your changes approved by the lead programmer.

## Contents
This repository contains the code for both the teleOP and Autonomos periods of the competion. Not all of the
programs show will be used. If you want to add your own code, please put it into your own folder rather than
 changing the official code. <i>Information about doing this is provided in the section labled Wirting Your Own
 Code.</i>


## Writing Your Own Code
If you would like to change any of the programs in the SkyStone folder, please make a copy of it first and
 change it in your folder. In the TeamCode> java> org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder, you should see a folder
 labled as your name.

 Steps for copying and updating the program are provided below.

 * Right click on the program file you would like to copy

 * Select the option that says Copy

 * Right click on your folder

 * Select the option that says Paste

 * Rename the file how ever you want

 * You may now change the file however you would like


 ## Upload New Code
 After you have changed anything in the code, you will have to commit and push it to the repository for other
 programmers to see. There are a few steps to change the code.

 * Click on the green check near the top right of the screen in Android Studio

 * Type in an update message (Say what you change, why you changed it, and your name)in the box labeled commit message

 * Click commit at the bottom of the pop-up

Once you finish doing all the prior steps, you will need to push the code to GitHub

* Hold Ctrl, Shift, and press 'k'

* Click Push at the bottom

* If you see a message telling you that there are no errors, only warning, you should be fine to push the code

* If you see a message that says there are some errors, <b>DO NOT PUSH THE CODE</b>. View the errors and fix them before pushing



## Getting Updated Code
If you want to get the latest code that has been pushed by other users, you will have to pull the data. This is much easier
 to do than pushing your code.

 * Click the blue arrow next to the green check mark

 * Click Ok
